Following are the programmatic commands which users need to copy paste in their localhost
i.e maybe wamp for windows, xampp for windows or mamp for ios.

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)



DELETE FROM Ages;


INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Zahra', 34);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Olufunke', 23);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Choire', 38);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Makenna', 32);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ula', 16);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Garren', 40);



SELECT sha1(CONCAT(name,age)) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X



An output will be obtained in your localhost like some encoded digits like:-

254c6127cdbc4c38e065317667340e8b0950046f
and many more rows.

Copy paste the first like of code i.e 254c6127cdbc4c38e065317667340e8b0950046f into the given status bar of the external graded tools.

Then you would get all the answers correctly.
